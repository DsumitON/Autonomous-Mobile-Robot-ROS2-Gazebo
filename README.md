# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot-ROS2-Gazebo
ROS2-based mobile robot simulation in Gazebo featuring LiDAR-based navigation, motion planning, and sensor fusion.

# ROS2 Mobile Robot Simulation 🚀

This project demonstrates an **autonomous mobile robot** built and simulated using **ROS2** and **Gazebo**. The robot uses **LiDAR-based navigation**, **sensor fusion**, and **motion planning algorithms** to navigate autonomously in a simulated environment.

## 🧠 Features
- ROS2 (Foxy/Humble) based robot control and navigation
- LiDAR integration for obstacle avoidance
- Gazebo simulation environment
- TF transformations and odometry
- Path planning and velocity control
- Visualized in RViz and Gazebo

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ROS2, Gazebo
- Python / C++
- RViz2, URDF, Sensor Fusion
- Navigation Stack 2 (Nav2)
